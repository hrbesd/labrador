Add Stylesheets for Simple HTML Pages

Goal
    We already had some simple html pages(without stylesheets), what you need to do is to design stylesheets to these pages according to our requirements.

The ToolBox
	We'll build a toolbox similar to ReciteMe.com (http://www.reciteme.com/). When you are in that site, click "Try Recite" on the top bar. In the new web page, click the "Toggle Plain Text" link to brought up the plain text channel. As you may see, they provide a plain text channel, and setup a small toolbox on the right side, making the web page more accessible. Our toolbox is similar to their's but with one exception, our toolbox DOES NOT sit ABOVE the page content, it is placed AROUND the page content on top or on the right side.
	The toolbox is NOT part of the web page, it is a way to enhance the user agent, so you need to design the toolbox in an elegant and natural way.
	The toolbox needs to be displayed on every web page in our site, and we already had some images designed for the buttons on the toolbox(the icons), you should make use of these images (or modify them when needed) to layout the toolbox on web pages. All images are designed with Illustrator.
	You need to design some UI effects for the pages. First, you need to design a layer to display the translate result just like what ReciteMe does. Second, you need to setup an area on the bottom of the page to display the magnified text, you need to give us an interface so we can toggle it.

The Existing Web Pages
	We have four main pages, namely, an index page(home.html), a column list page(columns.html), an article list page(list.html), and an article page(article.html), but we do not have any stylesheets designed for them.
	The index page mainly works as an entrance to the website, there should be a banner(we don't have one at this time, you can put a place holder image with the size of 800 * 100 in pixels for now), name of the site, and list of name of columns.
	In column page, all subcolumns should be listed. Every subcolumn is a link item on that page, displaying the name of that subcolumn.
	In list page, articles of a specific subcolumn are displayed. Every article is a link item on that page, in the form of "[title][publish time]".
	The article page shows the article content, including title, author, publish time and main content.
	Besides these 4 main pages, there are some introduction pages, including about.html, accessibility.html, browsers.html and sitemap.html. These pages are part of the website, and should be designed by you as well. Keep in mind that all pages should be designed in a same style.
	Toolbox is always displayed in all pages. Please refer to the attachment file for the html structure.

Your Responsibility:
	You are responsible for:
	- Designing Pages
		- You need to do the design work.
		- You have to design for these 8 pages in attachment files.
		- You need to design the toolbox layout, we will give you the icons for the buttons in the toolbox.
		- You need to provide 2 styles of the toolbox, namely, horizontal and vertical. The buttons in the toolbox are fixed but the layout may differ in these two styles.
		- All toolbox layout should be implemented in CSS file.
		- You need to provide us an interface, so we can switch between horizontal style and vertical style easily. Using class name in CSS will be fair enough.
		- These pages are for government websites, they need to be designed in a formal and elegent way.
		- You should design a mockup first with our given UI materials, so that we could discuss and verify that.

	- Writing Stylesheets
		- Write stylesheets for all 8 pages.
		- Take care of your coding style, we need to implement some functionality based on your CSS files, for example, we will allow the users to change the font size dynamically, and we hope you could write your stylesheets well, so we could just change the font size of a single element and effect the whole web page.
		- You don't have to design the icons for the toolbox, we already had them designed and will give them to you, feel free to use it.
		- You have to layout the toolbox horizontally and vertically, and you need to give us a clean interface so we could switch between them easily.
		- You have to design 4 themes, one for normal display, one for night mode, one for high contrast and one for equal height theme(in this theme, all text uses font with equally hight, which means all elements have the same font-size value). Please provide a clean interface so that we could change the theme to one of them easily.

	- Other
		- MUST finish it within 48 hours.
		- DO NOT remove the semantical elements in sample pages.
		- Designing 2 styles of the toolbox could be the tricky part, and how to switch between these 2 styles may be another challenge.
		- The minimum screen resolution supported should be 1024 * 768.
		- Support IE6+, Chrome 7+, Firefox 5+, Safari 4+.
